# Project Status

## Current Work

**Idle.**

M3 T44 S1-S5 are closed under owner-authorized automatic S progression.
The app/lib split and mirrored tests are complete; Mine import remains queued.
Three local products are available in assets/mario. Seventeen pre-existing
resource deletions remain unstaged and unrelated to this task.

## Current Technical Baseline

The Win32 text adapter has two projections of the same shared text frame.
Normal or visible Console devices that accept output VT use authored RGB SGR.
The hidden no-window 2x4 carrier used by run16 uses indexed sixteen-colour
`CHAR_INFO` output even when it accepts a VT mode bit. Capability selection
does not inspect process identity, window title, launcher, run16 name or game
input; it emits no terminal query and normal Escape remains the text exit key.

## Recent M3 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| --- | --- |
| T44 | NXVM-style src/lib, src/app-mario and mirrored test owners complete; Mine receiving paths prepared without importing code. x86/x64 300/300 plus 13 actual Console routes each, actual DOS device checks, DOS/Win16 relink and MZ/NE binder pass. Published products and bounded evidence retained; generated build workspaces cleaned. [History](../history/M3-T44-nxvm-source-test-layout.md). |
| T43 | Mario/shared KVM, Win32 and DOS16 owners separated; Win16/Mine receiving contracts prepared. Actual x86/x64 291/291 and 13 real Console routes each pass; DOS MZ/ABI/device evidence passes. Local three EXEs refreshed. Mine import remains future work. [History](../history/M3-T43-mygames-code-unification.md). |
| T42 | DOS Sound Blaster backend closes: unchanged shared frames feed the DOS16 integer renderer, DSP/DMA/IRQ route, and actual DOSBox product PCM capture. DOSBox host sound output remained unavailable in the owner's environment, while run16 is a documented no-device host. [History](../history/M3-T42-dos16-game-music.md). |
| T41 | Text-presentation quality closes: shared DOS/Win32 indexed colour projection, bounded conservative Win32 RGB VT presentation, owner-local tests and private-desktop host integration. x86/x64 283-test matrices and DOS16 link/I/O evidence passed; owner accepted and generated build outputs were removed. [History](../history/M3-T41-text-presentation-quality.md). |
| T40 | Win32 console-session identity and capability presentation close with owner-accepted CMD, graphical-Tab and run16 corpus. Normal/visible devices retain RGB VT; the hidden 2x4 carrier uses the stable standard-colour projection. Zero ROM nodes and edges. [History](../history/M3-T40-win32-console-session-identity.md). |
