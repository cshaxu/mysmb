# M2 T30: Area object rendering and metatile chains

T30 follows closed T29 geometry and resumes original source order at the first
uncompleted label after `FlagpoleObject`.  It owns the area-object rendering,
metatile and block-buffer portion of the recovery-plan range.  Each admitted S
receives one bounded chain from the existing T18 custody; future T30 chains
remain unadmitted until their exact predecessor and source route are recorded.

All behavior stays in portable `src/game`.  Windows and DOS provide only
input, timing and completed-frame submission.  The owner-supplied SMB1 NROM
and reviewed disassembly are local-only evidence inputs; no ROM-derived source
or trace becomes tracked product data.

## T30/S1 admission: rope object rendering chain

| Field | Record |
| --- | --- |
| Entry and exit | `EndlessRope -> DrawRope` |
| Exact source-order labels | `EndlessRope` (4018), `BalancePlatRope` (4023), `DrawRope` (4034) |
| Shared owner | `src/game/area.c`, including the neutral area-object state and its existing UnderPart collaborator |
| Receipt | `transfer-098-t18-s4-to-t30-s1-rope-rendering` transfers the three labels from T18 custody |
| Predecessor / successor | T29/S10's completed allocation/final-object boundary precedes this chain; `CoinMetatileData -> RowOfCoins` is the next unadmitted T30 chain |
| ROM-logic track | Audit `$99bb-$99cc`: Endless uses `X=0,Y=15`; balance saves/restores object offset, clears rows 1..15 using `$44`, obtains the lower-nibble length, then uses `X=1`; DrawRope tail-jumps with `$40`. The ordinary area-parser object route exercises the same parser dispatch; source-shaped object records cover the mutually exclusive endless and balance variants without leaf-PC or stack injection. |
| Operational track | Add focused project-owned rope/area smoke coverage, compare the chain-owned parser/metatile state against the original route, build x86/x64, link DOS16, run platform-purity, and refresh all three target artifacts once for implementation P1. |

Baseline: **430 / 1,992**.  Incoming state for every scope label is `open`.
Expected new matches: the same three labels.  Maximum result: **433 / 1,992**.
No renderer, platform adapter, unrelated area object, or `RenderUnderPart`
node receives credit in this S.

## T30 chain order after S1

T30 continues strictly in inventory source order.  The next admissions begin
with `CoinMetatileData -> RowOfCoins`, then retain the adjacent row/column,
cannon/stair, question/brick, hole/underpart, length/attribute and block-buffer
chains as separate receipts where their caller or ROM route changes.  This is
a boundary map only; no later T30 label is admitted or credited by S1.
