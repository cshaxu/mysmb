# M2 T40: Enemy movement, firebars and Lakitu distance

## Scope and source boundary

T39 closed in fa80503 at 1,059/1,992. T40 begins MovePodoboo at line 9212
and ends after ExMoveLak at line 10091. The previous line-10100 cut entered
BridgeCollapse; keep BridgeCollapseData (10092) and BridgeCollapse (10098)
with the complete bridge/Bowser chain in the next slice. This moves two
planned labels without changing their current receivers or match status.

Scope is 120 unique nodes: 107 incomplete targets and thirteen retained
matches. Maximum is 1,166/1,992. All incomplete labels currently belong to
T19 S5; retained normal-motion labels and tables belong to T31 S2. Only S1
receives its nodes now. Later S rows show planned ownership but retain their
current ledger receivers until their own admission.

## Source-ordered S plan

Every S delivers one whole control/data chain with original logic proof,
independent native validation and three EXEs. Distinct short movement leaves
stay separate when their original caller routes/branch families differ.
Adjacent timer tables, internal labels and normal-movement fallthrough remain
with their consumers. No separate mapping/test/paperwork S is added.

- S1: Expired/nonexpired timer, real InitPodoboo call, post-init PRNG read,
  force/timer/speed writes and unconditional MoveJ_EnemyVertically tail.
- S2: Hammer throw/jump timers, spawn carry, offscreen gate, PRNG jump length,
  shimmy/player-distance direction and direct normal/defeated fallthrough.
  Revalidate thirteen retained normal-motion/table nodes; do not double count.
- S3: Jumping gravity/horizontal order and red Paratroopa center/direction state.
- S4: Green X/Y modes, shared primary/secondary counters and signed movement.
- S5: Bloober direction, swim acceleration/deceleration, float-down/player gates
  and defeated tail, including source byte aliases and underflow behavior.
- S6: Bullet timer/defeat gates, signed horizontal motion and shared gravity.
- S7: Swimming-fish fractional X motion, Y anchor distance and direction flips.
- S8: Full firebar actor, tables and position/collision loop; long-bar aliases,
  mirrored offsets, OAM and injury gates belong to this continuous chain.
- S9: Flying-fish gravity, PRNG vertical adjustment and sprite priority state.
- S10: Lakitu range/turn/speed plus PlayerLakituDiff scratch and register result;
  reuse this helper for prior Spiny callers and expose their actual regressions.

Each admission names original entry/exit, dependency receipts, exact current
states and expected matches. Dependencies already proved in T37/T38/T39 are
reused; unproved child returns may be substituted only after complete input
comparison and with actual-child failures separately retained. Source and
native validation remain distinct. Every P refreshes DOS16/x86/x64 artifacts;
T closure combines the route matrix, exact node dispositions and platform
purity. No source-order jump or implicit child conformance is permitted.

## S1 admission: Podoboo movement

Coordinator accepts transfer-184 for MovePodoboo and PdbM, both open and
expected new. Baseline 1,059/1,992, maximum 1,061. Source $C9B0-$C9CD follows
EraseEnemyObject and ends at the unconditional MoveJ_EnemyVertically tail.
Shared owner is enemy/podoboo.c; actor/aggregate declarations remain compatible.
S2 is the next Hammer Bro/normal-motion chain.

Replace the copied inline initialization with the proven InitPodoboo entry.
Read PRNG only after that child returns; set force OR $80, timer (low nibble
OR six), speed $F9, then execute gravity on both timer branches. Remove the
non-source flag/ID check from the source entry and retain it only on the legacy
bulk interface. Do not modify initializer or gravity algorithms.

Original unchanged NMI routes cover both timer branches, PRNG extremes and
both edge slots; separate observer-free records check noninterference. Use
actual shared initializer/gravity comparison as the primary proof, with exact
child input/order records for diagnosis. Independent native contracts exercise
all six slots, every PRNG byte, post-init mutation and preserved unrelated RAM.
Recheck earlier actual matches, strict C90 x86/x64, DOS16 link, platform purity,
hidden-window response and all three EXEs. Stop on unadmitted child repair,
original CPU/ROM/stack patching or masked state differences.

Existing owner-local ROM/listing provenance and local-only redistribution
status are unchanged; no third-party implementation import. Generated data,
raw records, logs and intermediates stay in ignored build/m2-t40-s1, with
four-MB raw budget, twenty-second recorder timeout and S1 cleanup ownership.
Concurrent independent records use unique paths and stable checkpoint files.

## S1 original Podoboo proof

S1 P1 closes both expected nodes: 1,059 -> 1,061/1,992. Neither scoped
node remains unfinished or transferred. T40 continues with its planned S2.

| Node | Original address | Individual evidence and disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MovePodoboo | $C9B0 | Timer read/branch, real InitPodoboo child, post-child PRNG and force/timer/speed stores match; new ROM-match complete. |
| PdbM | $C9CB | Both paths unconditionally tail-call MoveJ_EnemyVertically, preserving initializer and gravity effects; new ROM-match complete. |

All twelve instructions in $C9B0-$C9CD execute in unchanged original-ROM
NMI routes. Sixteen roots take the expired branch and 48 the active branch;
slots zero/five and entry timers 0/1/2/255 are observed. The eight PRNG seed
values pass through the original NMI LFSR before entry; they are not falsely
reported as the same eight entry values. The actual post-initializer values
observed are 0, 3, 4, 7, 63, 64 and 127. Independent native contracts cover
all 256 post-child bytes on all six slots and four timer cases (6,144 cases
per width), with child-mutated eligibility flags and complete RAM footprints.

Original caller handoffs pass 128/128 across x86/x64, covering 80 child
records. Entry RAM is compared before any diagnostic recorded return is
used. Separately, real shared initializer and gravity execution also passes
128/128; these are the primary node proofs. Comparisons exclude hardware
stack bytes but retain mapped $0109-$0139 variables. Original ROM, CPU,
stack and scratch are never patched. All 64 observer-free frames equal the
observed recordings. This noninterference check does not claim full-game
native frame equality. Neither scoped caller writes PPU/audio state directly.

The shared movement now resides in enemy/podoboo.c. Its original source
entry has no extra flag/ID condition. The legacy aggregate retains its
eligibility filter before calling the same entry. InitPodoboo and gravity
remain their existing shared owners; the copied initializer and incorrect
old address comment are removed. No platform-specific gameplay was added.

Similar-issue sweep covers all Podoboo movement declarations, normal-vector
and bulk callers, initializer dispatcher/owner and graphics callers. The
normal vector directly reaches the new entry; only the legacy bulk interface
filters objects. Initialization has one implementation. The graphics entry
is unchanged and no graphics node receives credit. Adjacent actor algorithms
retain their planned later S ownership.

Strict C90 builds pass for all 89 shared units on x86/x64. Self-tests and
hidden-window message-response probes pass on both widths; platform purity
passes. Fifteen prior full native suites plus normal/vector/retainer/cannon
caller contracts pass per width. Existing Bowser damage and endgame star
timer failures remain unchanged; existing Spiny and other child gaps remain.
DOS16 builds/links with the pre-existing OLDNAMES warning and remains
link-only: no DOS graphics, resource-binding or 486 performance claim.

The integrated original-snapshot matrix is 3,382/4,170; all 3,254 previously
passing comparisons remain passing. Remaining differences retain their
existing source-order owners.

Reproduce with podoboo_movement_fixture.h cases 0..63,
--fixture=t40-podoboo=N, --podoboo-snapshot, --control-children and a separate
--pc-coverage run. podoboo_snapshot_check diagnoses caller handoffs;
enemy_loop_actual_check executes real children. mysmb.podoboo-movement is
the native mutation-contract target. Local source-audit.json and checkpoint
summaries record exact coverage. Raw records occupy 873,952 bytes under the
four-MB bound in ignored build/m2-t40-s1, with unique concurrent paths and
twenty-second per-run timeout. They remain local regression inputs while
the admitted dependent chains need them. Source provenance is unchanged.
The three owner-authorized EXEs are refreshed together.
